<p>What is <a href="Virtual classroom" class="virtual">Virtual Classroom?</a></p>
       <p><small>A virtual classroom is a digital replica of a traditional classroom or training room. 
           The instructors teach, and the participants learn in real-time, face-to-face but via internet-enabled technology devices. 
           The classroom or the meeting room staple – whiteboard – remains intact. Brainstorming, ideation, and discussions 
          happen in real-time. Tests are given and taken pre and post the session. 
          The reports are ready right after the session is over.
           Everything remains the way it is. The only difference is: an online classroom uses technology to support instruction and learning. 
          What are the advantages of virtual classroom? It offers more flexibility over a traditional classroom. 
          You can deliver the instruction to a geographically dispersed audience at one time. 
           Both the instructors and learners have rich experience of collaborating with other learners and instructors 
           from around the world. The attendance is automatically tracked. Moreover, 
          online colloboration typically incorporates more communication tools, such as chat, open 
          discussion boards, polls, multimedia content and social media.</small></p>
           <p><small> online class software works in a similar fashion for businesses. You can train employees, vendors, partners, 
        and customers face-to-face in real-time via a standalone app or you can also integrate it with your website, CMS, ERP or LMS. 
        You can conduct the training even when the stakeholders are on the move. 
        They can access the eLearning material and attend the live session from their smartphones, tablets or laptops.</small></p>
